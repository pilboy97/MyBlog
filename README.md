# MyBlog
This is a project for my personal blog. Main ideas are:
* all articles will be written in md file, so that I can upload them on my github repo.
* visitors can leave comments.
* data of all visitors will be stored and be analyzed
* all pages can be interpreted in visitors language (eg. Eng, Jpn, etc.)
