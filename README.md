# MyBlog  
This is a project for my personal blog. Main ideas are:  
* All articles will be written in Markdown files, so that I can upload them to my GitHub repository.  
* Visitors will be able to leave comments.  
* Data from all visitors will be stored and analyzed.  
* All pages can be translated into visitors' languages (e.g., English, Japanese, etc.).
